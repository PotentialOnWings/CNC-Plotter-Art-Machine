 - Read instructions carefully (name of file). (-1)
 - Good staging of project.
 - perform any OpenCV stuff outside of arduino environment and forward any results back to your arduino. You can simplify this part by not using C if you know another language (like python). Up to you. You already have quite a bit complexity. I think we talked about this with Derek actually... :)

> As for the hardware, maintaining the accuracy of the pen such that it moves in sync with the expected paths according to the software would also be a challenge 

 - As long as you keep the pen rigid that shouldn't be a problem. The real issue (if any) is trying to keep the pen in contact with the paper; that is, keeping pressure sufficiently high so that the pen writes.
